"""Plans, limits and the unified credit pool.

One credit currency for the whole product; different actions cost a different
number of credits. The per-action breakdown lives in public.credit_events so
usage can be reported split (analyses vs presentations) without separate pools.
Volume-first pricing (the Gamma model): credits are cheap in bulk, actions
draw visibly large amounts. Anchor: EUR 20 -> 4000 credits (~EUR 0.005/cr).
